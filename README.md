# Discord Music Bot

I was tired of music bots being restricted by copyright laws, so I decided to create my own. This bot lets you play songs and playlists from YouTube using simple commands.

## Features
- Play songs from YouTube URLs
- Play entire YouTube playlists
- Pause, resume, and skip songs
- View, clear, and shuffle the queue
- Auto-plays the next song in the queue
- Joins and leaves voice channels automatically

## Commands

| `!pause`      | Pauses the current song |
